# **INTRODUCTION TO SUSU COFFEE PROJECT**

## **1. Purpose of the service**

**Target users:** The intended users of this project are owners or managers of small-to-medium cafés and drink shops.

**Current problems:** At present, many shops of this size still manage operations manually with notebooks and paper documents. This leads to several difficulties such as:

* Taking orders and calculating bills is prone to mistakes and confusion.
* It's hard to quickly track the status of each table (which tables are free, which are occupied).
* Managing staff information, timekeeping, and payroll is fragmented and time-consuming.

**Project solution:** The "Susu Coffee Management" website was created to provide a centralized, simple, and intuitive management tool that addresses the problems above and helps make shop operations smoother and more efficient.

## **2. Overview**

* **Development time:** 1 month.
* **Team members:** 1 person (personal project).
* **Technologies used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* **Why these technologies:** I chose these technologies because they are the core foundations of the web and allow rapid development of an intuitive user interface that runs directly in the browser without requiring a complex backend. Given the goal of quickly solving basic management needs for users, this choice is the most suitable.

## **3. Problem-solving approach**

To address the problems listed above, the project focuses on four main feature groups:

1. **Menu management**

   * **Function:** Allows staff to manage the shop’s menu data — add new items, edit data, and delete items from the menu.
   * **How it helps:** This feature enables staff to easily manage the shop’s list of menu items.

2. **Bill management**

   * **Function:** Allows staff to select items from the list, add them to a cart, and automatically calculate the total to issue a bill.
   * **How it helps:** This feature visualizes the menu and automates calculations, minimizing errors compared to handwritten methods and making customer checkout faster and more professional.

3. **Seating management**

   * **Function:** Provides a visual table layout that clearly shows whether each table is “available” or “being served.”
   * **How it helps:** Helps staff quickly identify free tables for seating new customers and easily manage orders by table, optimizing service.

4. **Staff management**

   * **Function:** Allows managers to add, edit, and delete staff information, including shifts and pay rates.
   * **How it helps:** Digitizes and centralizes personnel data, making information lookup, scheduling, and payroll calculations much simpler and more accurate.

## **4. Improvements & future updates**

**Features to develop:**

* **Inventory and expense management:** Add functionality to track quantities of ingredients received and associated costs.
* **Revenue reports:** Build a system for statistics and revenue reports by day, week, and month.

**Why:** These features will give managers a broader and deeper view of the business situation, enabling strategic decisions to optimize costs and increase profits.

## **5. PR points**

* **User experience focus:** The interface is designed to be minimal, intuitive, and easy to use, targeted at non-technical users so they can adopt and use it immediately without complex training.
